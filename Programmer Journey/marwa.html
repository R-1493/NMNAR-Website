                        <h3>My Story</h3>
                        <p>
                          My story begins when I graduated from high school and prepared for the new academic life, which is university,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Registration doors are open ! With enthusiasm, I enrolled in the university, 
                          and my first desires were medicine,then engineering and computers, 
                          but I was accepted into computer science! I was so disappointed so I decided to study a year and then switch to medicine, 
                          but soon my opinion changed a lot and I liked my specialty very much <span>Wow, it's become my passion now !</span>
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>My Start</h3>
                        <p> 
                          Since the beginning of my acceptance into the "Computer Science",<br> I have been thinking... 
                      </p>
                      <p class="pdd">
                          What is this science?<br>
                          What are its extensions?<br>
                          What exactly do I want from this vast sea?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          Therefore.. I could not help but pack my belongings, fight and travel hard !<br>
                          To the computer world and try everything until I find my field that I love and get creative in it ..

                        There are many accomplishments that I am proud of, such as:<br>
                        1. I participated in a programming competition entitled Saudi Tech<br>
                        2. I repaired my laptop myself at home<br>
                        3. I learned new programming languages<br>
                        4. I was accepted into the Google Developer Club<br>
                        ................<br>
                        But I didn't stop there InshaAllah <span>ãƒ„</span>
